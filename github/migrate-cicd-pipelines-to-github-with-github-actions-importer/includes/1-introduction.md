GitHub Actions Importer is designed to help you forecast, plan, and facilitate migrations from your current CI/CD tool to GitHub Actions. 

Doing individual migrations is relatively easy in isolation. However, if you have a large and established CI/CD footprint, having a tool capable to assist with migrations is key to your ability to adopt GitHub Actions at scale.

## Learning objectives

In this module you will:

- Review how to install the GitHub Actions Importer and ensure it's up to date
- Learn about the GitHub Actions Importer commands: audit, forecast, dry-run, and migrate as well as learn what is not automatically migrated
- Run through a mock migration lab exercise for a supported CI platform 

## Prerequisites:

- A GitHub account
- Prior working knowledge of GitHub Actions
- Organizational access to one of the supported CI/CD platforms  
- Ability to execute the accompanying labs exercises within GitHub Codespaces

As you'll learn from this module, you can use GitHub Actions Importer to plan and automatically migrate your CI/CD pipelines to GitHub Actions from these supported platforms below. 

- [Azure DevOps](https://github.com/actions/importer-labs/blob/main/azure_devops/readme.md)
- [CircleCI](https://github.com/actions/importer-labs/blob/main/circle_ci/readme.md)
- [GitLab](https://github.com/actions/importer-labs/blob/main/gitlab/readme.md)
- [Jenkins](https://github.com/actions/importer-labs/blob/main/jenkins/readme.md)
- [Travis CI](https://github.com/actions/importer-labs/blob/main/travis/readme.md)

It is imperative to review every workflow that is converted by the GitHub Actions Importer for correctness before using it as a production workload. 

The goal is to achieve an 80% conversion rate for every workflow, but like all things, the actual conversion rate will depend on your specific makeup of your  pipelines. 

To set expectations it is important to note that there are a couple of things that won't be autmatically migrated when you use GitHub Actions Importer.

#### What is not automatically migrated:

- Secrets and encrypted values 
- Self-hosted build agents
- Historical packages
- Permissions for CI/CD pipelines
- Build steps or build triggers

Now, let's dive into how to install GitHub Actions Importer and ensure it is up-to-date.
