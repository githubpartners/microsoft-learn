This exercise checks your knowledge on the basics of QL and CodeQL.

You have learned that QL is optimized to enable efficient analysis of hierarchical data structures. QL uses common logical connectives (such as and, or, and not). Simple queries use some of the basic functions that are available for the int, date, float, boolean and string types.

In this exercise, you will write a query which returns the length of the string "lgtm".

Here in the [CodeQL documentation](https://codeql.github.com/), here is [Exercise 1](https://codeql.github.com/docs/writing-codeql-queries/introduction-to-ql/#exercise-1).

Following the exercise, is the module summary.
