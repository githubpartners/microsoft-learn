Code scanning using CodeQL provides an extensible method to automate vulnerability scanning across your organization's GitHub repositories.

Imagine that you are a senior developer at a start-up company specializing in health care software. Your flagship product is a Java-based web portal that allows physicians to manage patient records. A recent penetration test of this product revealed a number of serious vulnerabilities that could compromise patient information. The CIO has asked you to implement automated code vulnerability scanning. Because your code is already hosted in a private repository on GitHub, you have decided to use the code scanning feature with CodeQL. You will need to understand how the feature works to persuade other developers and management to use the feature.

In this module, you will learn about the CodeQL static analysis tool and how the code scanning feature in GitHub uses it to automate vulnerability scanning.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understanding variant analysis, CodeQL databases, query suites, and query language packs relevancy with Code Scanning
- How to run a CodeQL analysis
- What is QL and how to use it with Code Scanning 

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub enterprise account with a GitHub Advanced Security license
- Necessary permissions to administrate your repository
- Knowledge of GitHub Advanced Security's code scanning feature
- Knowledge of GitHub Actions

Next up, you'll learn how CodeQL is used by developers.
