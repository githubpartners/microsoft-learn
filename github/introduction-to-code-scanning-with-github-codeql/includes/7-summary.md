You now understand how code scanning with CodeQL works and how to configure it, so that you can help your entire organization adopt it.

Without using GitHub code scanning with CodeQL, it would be very difficult to automate both the scanning of your code, as well as generating pull requests to fix the vulnerable code. In addition, CodeQL provides an extensive, growing library of queries in multiple languages that help you create more secure code with little engineering effort.

Successfully rolling out automated code vulnerability scanning across your organization has made developers more productive and the product at your company more secure.
