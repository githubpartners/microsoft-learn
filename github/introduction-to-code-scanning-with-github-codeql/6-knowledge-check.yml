quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "In CodeQL, errors like bugs and vulnerabilities are modeled as:"
    choices:
    - content: "Data"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "CodeQL treats *code* like data, but errors in the code are modeled differently."
    - content: "Queries"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Processes"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "CodeQL is used to perform the *process* of variant analysis."
  - content: "How many default query suites are there with GitHub code scanning with CodeQL?"
    choices:
    - content: "One (1)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "There are three default query suites for CodeQL"
    - content: "Two (2)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "There are three default query suites for CodeQL"
    - content: "Three (3)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! There are three default query suites for CodeQL"
  - content: "Which of the following are part of a CodeQL database?"
    choices:
    - content: "A representation of the language's abstract syntax tree"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! A representation of the language's abstract syntax tree is a part of a CodeQL database."
    - content: "Query length (.qlg) files"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: ""Query length files are not a part of CodeQL. Query library (.qll) files are used in CodeQL, but are not a part of the database."
    - content: "A logic flow graph"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A data flow graph is a part of a CodeQL database. A logic flow graph is not."
  - content: "The final step of CodeQL analysis is:"
    choices:
    - content: "Interpreting the results"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The final step converts results produced during query execution into a form that is more meaningful in the context of the source code."
    - content: "Running CodeQL queries against the database"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Running CodeQL queries against the database is the second step of CodeQL analysis."
    - content: "Creating a CodeQL database"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Creating a CodeQL database is the first step of CodeQL analysis."
  - content: "What feature does QL add to the Datalog programming language?"
    choices:
    - content: "Recursive predicates"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "QL inherits recursive predicates from Datalog."
    - content: "Complexity to Datadog"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "QL inherits recursive predicates from Datalog, and adds support for aggregates, making even complex queries concise and simple."
    - content: "Support for aggregates"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Furthermore, QL inherits recursive predicates from Datalog, and adds support for aggregates."
