When integrating with code scanning you will need to decide which tool you want to use for analysis and how you want to generate alerts.

Imagine that you continue to be a senior developer at a start-up company specializing in health care software. You will need to understand the various configuration options. You will also need to know how to implement and maintain a code scanning pipeline to assist other developers at your company in configuring and deploying code scanning correctly.

In this module, you will learn about integrating with code scanning, set up code scanning with GitHub Actions, use the CodeQL command-line interface (CLI), and understand what hardware resources to use with CodeQL.
