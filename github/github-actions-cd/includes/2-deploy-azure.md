Here, we'll discuss how to use GitHub actions to deploy a container-based web app to Microsoft Azure Web Apps. First, we'll discuss some options for triggering a workflow. Next, we'll show you how to work with conditionals in the workflow. Finally, we'll talk about how to create and delete Azure resources by using GitHub Actions.

## Options for triggering a CD workflow

There are several options for starting a CD workflow. Let's talk about a few of them.

In the previous module on CI with GitHub Actions, you learned how to trigger a workflow from a push to the GitHub repository. However, for CD, you may want to trigger a deployment workflow on some other event.

One option is to trigger the workflow with *ChatOps*. ChatOps uses chat clients, chatbots, and real-time communication tools to execute tasks. For example, you might leave a specific comment in a pull request that can kick off a bot. That bot might comment back with some statistics or run a workflow.

Another option, and the one we use in our example, is to use labels in your pull request. Different labels can start different workflows. For example, add a *stage* label to begin a deployment workflow to your staging environment, or add a *spin up environment* label to run the workflow that creates the Microsoft Azure resources you will deploy to. To use labels, your workflow will look like this:

```yml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [labeled]
```

Workflow re-runs in GitHub Actions will use the initial runâ€™s actor for privilege evaluation. The actor who triggered the re-run will continue to be displayed in the UI, and accessed in a workflow via the `triggering_actor` field in the `github` context.

## Control execution with a job conditional

Often, you only want to run a workflow if some condition is true. 

GitHub workflows provide the *if* conditional for this scenario. The conditional uses an [expression](https://help.github.com/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions?azure-portal=true) that will be evaluated at runtime. For example, we want to run this workflow if a *stage* label is added to the pull request.

```yml
if: contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'stage')
```

## Store credentials with GitHub Secrets

Of course, you never want to expose sensitive information in the workflow file. GitHub Secrets is a secure place to store sensitive information that your workflow will need. Here's an example.

In order to deploy to an Azure resource, the GitHub Action must have permission to access the resource. You don't want to store your Azure credentials in plain sight in the workflow file. Instead, you can store your credentials in GitHub Secrets.

To store information in GitHub Secrets, you'll create a secret on the portal.

Then, you'll use the name of the secret you created in your workflow wherever you need that information. For example, here we'll use the Azure credential that was stored in GitHub Secrets in the ```creds:``` attribute of an Azure ```login``` action. (We'll talk about that action in the next section.)

```yml
steps:
      - name: "Login via Azure CLI"
        uses: azure/login@v1
        with:
          creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
```

## Deploy to Microsoft Azure using GitHub Actions

The [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions&query=azure&azure-portal=true) has several actions that help you automate Azure-related tasks.

:::image type="content" source="../media/2-marketplace-azure.png" alt-text="The GitHub Marketplace showing search results for Azure." border="true":::

You can also search and browse GitHub Actions directly in a repository's workflow editor. From the sidebar, you can search for a specific Action, view featured Actions, and browse featured categories.

To find an Action:

1. In your repository, browse to the workflow file that you want to edit.
1. Click the **Edit** icon in the upper right corner of the file view.
1. Use the GitHub Marketplace sidebar to the right of the editor to browse Actions.

Suppose you want to deploy a container-based web app to Azure Web Apps. If you search the GitHub Marketplace you find these actions:

- [azure/webapps-container-deploy@v1](https://github.com/Azure/webapps-container-deploy?azure-portal=true)
- [azure/login@v1](https://github.com/Azure/login?azure-portal=true) that we saw previously  
- [azure/docker-login@v1](https://github.com/Azure/docker-login?azure-portal=true)

If you add these actions to the ```Deploy-to-Azure``` job, your workflow looks like this:

```yml
  Deploy-to-Azure:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: Build-Docker-Image
    name: Deploy app container to Azure
    steps:
      - name: "Login via Azure CLI"
        uses: azure/login@v1
        with:
          creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}

      - uses: azure/docker-login@v1
        with:
          login-server: ${{env.IMAGE_REGISTRY_URL}}
          username: ${{ github.actor }}
          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Deploy web app container
        uses: azure/webapps-container-deploy@v1
        with:
          app-name: ${{env.AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME}}
          images: ${{env.IMAGE_REGISTRY_URL}}/${{ github.repository }}/${{env.DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME}}:${{ github.sha }}

      - name: Azure logout
        run: |
          az logout
```

Notice that this job depends on a previous job, ```Build-Docker-Image```. The previous job creates the artifact that gets deployed.

The [azure/login@v1](https://github.com/Azure/login?azure-portal=true) action needs credentials to sign in to your Azure account so that it can access the Azure resources that you want to deploy to. Here, we'll use the credentials that we stored in GitHub Secrets.

The same is true for the [azure/docker-login@v1](https://github.com/Azure/docker-login?azure-portal=true) action. Since you're deploying a container image, you'll need to sign in to your private container registry.

The [azure/webapps-container-deploy@v1](https://github.com/Azure/webapps-container-deploy?azure-portal=true) action performs the deployment. It depends on the two preceding actions.

## Create and delete Azure resources by using GitHub Actions

Because CD is an automated process, you've already decided to use infrastructure as code to create and take down the environments you deploy to. GitHub Actions can automate these tasks on Azure, and you can include these actions in your workflow. 

> [!NOTE]
>Remember that it's important to tear down resources that you're no longer using as soon as possible to avoid unnecessary charges.

One option is to create a new workflow with two jobs, one that spins up resources and one that deletes them. Then, use a conditional to run only the job you want. In this example, the conditional looks for a label in the pull request and runs the ```set-up-azure-resources``` job if the label is *spin up environment* and the ```destroy-azure-resources``` job if the label is *destroy environment*.

```yml
jobs:
  set-up-azure-resources:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    if: contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'spin up environment')

    ...

  destroy-azure-resources:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    if: contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'destroy environment')

    ...
```

The jobs use the Azure CLI to create and destroy the Azure resources. If you're not familiar with Azure CLI, check out [Overview of Azure CLI](/cli/azure/?azure-portal=true&view=azure-cli-latest) in the Microsoft documentation.

Here's an example of the steps in the ```set-up-azure-resources``` job:

```yml
steps:
  - name: Checkout repository
    uses: actions/checkout@v2

  - name: Azure login
    uses: azure/login@v1
    with:
      creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}

  - name: Create Azure resource group
    if: success()
    run: |
      az group create --location ${{env.AZURE_LOCATION}} --name ${{env.AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP}} --subscription ${{secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID}}
  - name: Create Azure app service plan
    if: success()
    run: |
      az appservice plan create --resource-group ${{env.AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP}} --name ${{env.AZURE_APP_PLAN}} --is-linux --sku F1 --subscription ${{secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID}}
  - name: Create webapp resource
    if: success()
    run: |
      az webapp create --resource-group ${{ env.AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP }} --plan ${{ env.AZURE_APP_PLAN }} --name ${{ env.AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME }}  --deployment-container-image-name nginx --subscription ${{secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID}}
  - name: Configure webapp to use GitHub Packages
    if: success()
    run: |
      az webapp config container set --docker-custom-image-name nginx --docker-registry-server-password ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}} --docker-registry-server-url https://docker.pkg.github.com --docker-registry-server-user ${{github.actor}} --name ${{ env.AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME }} --resource-group ${{ env.AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP }} --subscription ${{secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID}}

```

Notice that you use GitHub actions to check out the repository and to sign in to Azure. After that, you create the resources you need and deploy the container by using the Azure CLI.

## Secure deployments

You can take a more secure cloud deployment approach by configuring your workflow to request a short-lived access token directly from the cloud provider. This is because Actions supports OpenID Connect (OIDC). Without OIDC, you would need to store a credential or token as an encrypted secret in GitHub and present that secret to the cloud provider every time it runs. The new OIDC support gives you a very clear separation of the configuration that you need to manage in GitHub and the permissions that you need to manage in the cloud portal, making cloud deployments simpler to set up and more secure.

You can configure the OIDC trust on your cloud provider and then update your workflows to request a short-lived access token from the cloud provider through OIDC. This means that you wonâ€™t need to add long-lived cloud credentials as GitHub secrets and worry about token expiry and rotating them. You have more granular control over which workflows can access cloud resources by using your cloud providerâ€™s authentication (authN) and authorization (authZ) tools.

## Disable Actions workflows

You can temporarily disable a GitHub Actions workflow either in the UI or through the API. This functionality allows you to stop a workflow from being triggered without having to delete the file from the repo. Later, you can easily re-enable it again from the UI or through the API.

Next, we'll cover how to remove workflow artifacts from GitHub and change the default retention period.
