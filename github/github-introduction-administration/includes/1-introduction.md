GitHub administrators work to protect their organization's code and content assets while providing each team access to the repositories they rely on to collaborate and share their work.

Imagine that your CIO asks you for an adoption plan to help the entire company benefit from GitHub. You want to ensure every group has adequate access to the right repositories and that there's a sustainable way to provide adequate permissions to the appropriate software development and content teams. You'll need to think through the kinds of tasks that administrators need to perform and assign them the right level of access. But first, you really need to understand what options are available to you from GitHub.

In this module, you'll learn about:

- GitHub administrative tasks and their purpose at each hierarchical level.
- The various ways that administrators can configure authentication so that users can access GitHub via the web browser and the git client. 
- Hierarchical permission levels and what these permissions allow you to do in GitHub.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Summarize the organizational structures and permission levels that GitHub administrators can use to organize members to control access and security.
- Identify the various technologies that enable a secure authentication strategy, allowing administrators to centrally manage repository access.
- Describe the technologies required to centrally manage teams and members using existing directory information services and how you can use GitHub itself as an identity provider for authentication and authorization.
