GitHub Codespaces is a dedicated environment for you. You can configure your repositories with a dev container to define their default GitHub Codespaces environment, and personalize your development experience across all of your codespaces with dotfiles and Settings Sync.

## What you can personalize

## Settings you can personalize setting sync and dotfiles

## Personalizing your Codespace with extensions or plugins
You can add plugins and extensions within a Codespace to personalize your experience in JetBrains and VS Code.
### VS Code extensions
If you work on your Codespaces in the VS Code desktop application or the web client, you can add any extensions you need from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. For information on how extensions run in GitHub Codespaces, see Supporting Remote Development and GitHub Codespaces in the VS Code documentation.

If you already use VS Code, you can use Settings Sync to automatically sync extensions, settings, themes, and keyboard shortcuts between your local instance and any Codespaces you create.
## JetBrains plugins
If you work on your codespaces in a JetBrains IDE, you can add plugins from the JetBrains Marketplace.
