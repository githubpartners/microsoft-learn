## About GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) pair programmer that you can use to get suggestions for whole lines or entire functions right inside your editor.

It draws context from comments and code to suggest individual lines and whole functions instantly. 

It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

Research has found that GitHub Copilot has helped 96% of developers with repetitive fast, which allows them to focus on solving bigger problems and feeling more productive and fulfilled in their work. 

GitHub Copilot is powered by OpenAI Codex, a generative pretrained language model created by OpenAI. It is available as an extension for Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Neovim, and the JetBrains suite of integrated development environments (IDEs).

## About GitHub Copilot X

As the landscape of AI developer tools changes at lighting speed, GitHub wanted to ensure we remain at the cutting edge of innovation and improvements.

Introducing GitHub Copilot X. 

GitHub's vision for the future of AI-powered software development.

We wanted to move past the editor and evolve GitHub Copilot into a readily accessible AI assistant throughout the entire development life cycle.

Here are some features you can expect from GitHub Copilot X:
- **A ChatGPT-like experience in your editor with GitHub Copilot Chat**
   - We are bringing a chat interface to the editor that’s focused on developer scenarios and natively integrates with VS Code and Visual Studio. It recognizes what code a developer has typed, what error messages are shown, and it’s deeply embedded into the IDE. A developer can get in-depth analysis and explanations of what code blocks are intended to do, generate unit tests, and even get proposed fixes to bugs.
- **Copilot for Pull Requests**
   - This new functionality is powered by OpenAI’s new GPT-4 model and adds support for AI-powered tags in pull request descriptions through a GitHub app that organization admins and individual repository owners can install. These tags are automatically filled out by GitHub Copilot based on the changed code. Developers can then review or modify the suggested description.
- **AI-generated answers about documentation**
   - We are launching GitHub Copilot for Docs, an experimental tool that uses a chat interface to provide users with AI-generated responses to questions about documentation—including questions developers have about the languages, frameworks, and technologies they’re using.
- **Copilot for the command line interface (CLI):**
   - GitHub Copilot CLI can compose commands and loops and throw around obscure find flags to satisfy your query. 

## About GitHub Copilot for Business

With GitHub Copilot for Business, we’re opening it up to every developer, team, organization, and enterprise.

Focused on making your organization more productive, secure, and fulfilled, it allows your developers to code faster and allows them to focus on more satisfying work. 

Here are some features you can expect from Copilot for Business:
- A more powerful AI model: New modeling algorithms improve the quality of code suggestions.
- AI-based security vulnerability filtering: GitHub Copilot automatically blocks common insecure code suggestions by targeting issues such as hardcoded credentials, SQL injections, and path injections.
- VPN proxy support: GitHub Copilot works with VPNs, including with self-signed certificates, so developers can use it in any working environment.
- Simple sign-up: Any company can quickly purchase Copilot for Business licenses online, and easily assign seats—even if they don’t use the GitHub platform for their source code.
