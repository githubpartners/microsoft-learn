From reading docs to writing code to submitting pull requests and beyond, GitHub is working to personalize GitHub Copilot for every team, project, and repository it’s used in, creating a radically improved software development lifecycle. Together with [Microsoft’s knowledge model](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/), GitHub is harnessing the reservoir of data and insights that exist in every organization, to strengthen the connection between all workers and developers, so every idea can go from code to reality without friction. At the same time, GitHub will continue to innovate and update the heart of GitHub Copilot—the AI pair programmer that started it all.
