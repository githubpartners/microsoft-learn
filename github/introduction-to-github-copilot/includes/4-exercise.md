This exercise will walk you through the following steps:

- Install GitHub Copilot using GitHub Codespaces
- Prompt GitHub Copilot for code suggestions
- Accept code suggestions from GitHub Copilot

## Getting started

When you click the Start the exercise on GitHub button below, you'll be navigated to a public GitHub template repository that will prompt you to complete a series of small challenges. Before you can begin the exercise, complete the below tasks:

Select the Start course button or the Use this template feature within the template repository. This will prompt you to create a new repository. We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will use Actions minutes. After you make your own repository from the template, wait about 20 seconds and refresh.

Follow the instructions in the repository's README to understand how the exercise works, its learning objectives, and how to successfully complete the exercise.

When you've finished the exercise in GitHub, return back to this module for:
