GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that you can use to get suggestions for whole lines or entire functions right inside your editor.

In this unit, you’ll learn about GitHub Copilot and how the tool provides autocomplete suggestions.

## About GitHub Copilot

When you utilize GitHub Copilot, you will receive code suggestions by starting to write the code you want to use, or by writing a natural language comment describing what you want the code to do. GitHub Copilot analyzes the context in the file you are editing, as well as related files, and offers suggestions from within your text editor. GitHub Copilot is powered by OpenAI Codex, a new AI system created by OpenAI.

GitHub Copilot can help with each language that appears in public repositories. The quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot's best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot can be used with GitHub.com, Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim as an unobtrusive extension.
