## About GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) pair programmer that you can use to get suggestions for whole lines or entire functions right inside your editor.

It draws context from comments and code to suggest individual lines and whole functions instantly. 

It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

Research has found that GitHub Copilot has helped 96% of developers with repetitive fast, which allows them to focus on solving bigger problems and feeling more productive and fufilled in their work. 

GitHub Copilot is powered by OpenAI Codex, a generative pretrained language model created by OpenAI. It is available as an extension for Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Neovim, and the JetBrains suite of integrated development environments (IDEs).

## About GitHub Copilot X

As the landscape of AI developer tools changes at lightening speed, GitHub wanted to ensure we remain at the cutting edge of innovation and improvements.

Introducing GitHub Copilot X. 

GitHub's vision for the future of AI-powered software development.

We wanted to move past the editor and evolve GitHub Copilot into a readily accessible AI assistant throughout the enire development lifecycle.

Here are some features you can expect from GitHub Copilot X:
- **A ChatGPT-like experience in your editor with GitHub Copilot Chat**
   - We are bringing a chat interface to the editor that’s focused on developer scenarios and natively integrates with VS Code and Visual Studio. It recognizes what code a developer has typed, what error messages are shown, and it’s deeply embedded into the IDE. A developer can get in-depth analysis and explanations of what code blocks are intended to do, generate unit tests, and even get proposed fixes to bugs.
- **Copilot for Pull Requests**
   - This new functionality is powered by OpenAI’s new GPT-4 model and adds support for AI-powered tags in pull request descriptions through a GitHub app that organization admins and individual repository owners can install. These tags are automatically filled out by GitHub Copilot based on the changed code. Developers can then review or modify the suggested description.
- **AI-generated answers about documentation**
   - We are launching GitHub Copilot for Docs, an experimental tool that uses a chat interface to provide users with AI-generated responses to questions about documentation—including questions developers have about the languages, frameworks, and technologies they’re using.
- **Copilot for the command line interface (CLI):**
   - GitHub Copilot CLI can compose commands and loops and throw around obscure find flags to satisfy your query. 


## How to get started with GitHub Copilot

When you utilize GitHub Copilot, you will receive code suggestions by starting to write the code you want to use, or by writing a natural language comment describing what you want the code to do. GitHub Copilot analyzes the context in the file you are editing, as well as related files, and offers suggestions from within your text editor. GitHub Copilot is powered by OpenAI Codex, a new AI system created by OpenAI.

GitHub Copilot can help with each language that appears in public repositories. The quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot's best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

### Signing up for GitHub Copilot for your personal account

You need to set up a free trial or subscription for your personal account before you can start using GitHub Copilot. You can do so by clicking on your profile photo and then found in **Settings**. After you sign up, you can add an extension to Visual Studio Code. Other extensions work with GitHub.com, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim as an unobtrusive extension. GitHub Copilot provides suggestions for numerous languages and a wide variety of frameworks, but works especially well for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Go, C# and C++.

### Add the Visual Studio Code extension

Here is how you can add the Visual Studio Code extension.

- In the Visual Studio Code Marketplace, go to the GitHub Copilot extension page and click **Install**
- A popup will appear, asking to open Visual Studio Code, and then click **Open Visual Studio Code**
- In the Extension: GitHub Copilot tab in Visual Studio Code, click **Install**
- If you have not previously authorized Visual Studio Code in your GitHub account, you will be prompted to sign in to GitHub in Visual Studio Code
  - If you have previously authorized Visual Studio Code in your GitHub account, GitHub Copilot will be automatically authorized.
- In your browser, GitHub will request the necessary permissions for GitHub Copilot. To approve these permissions, click Authorize **Visual Studio Code**
- In Visual Studio Code, in the Visual Studio Code dialogue box, to confirm the authentication, click **Open**

You successfully installed GitHub Copilot and that's just the beginning!
