## About GitHub Copilot

When you utilize GitHub Copilot, you will receive code suggestions by starting to write the code you want to use, or by writing a natural language comment describing what you want the code to do. GitHub Copilot analyzes the context in the file you are editing, as well as related files, and offers suggestions from within your text editor. GitHub Copilot is powered by OpenAI Codex, a new AI system created by OpenAI.

GitHub Copilot can help with each language that appears in public repositories. The quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot's best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

### Signing up for GitHub Copilot for your personal account

You need to set up a free trial or subscription for your personal account before you can start using GitHub Copilot. You can do so by clicking on your profile photo and then found in **Settings**. After you sign up, you can add an extension to Visual Studio Code. Other extensions work with GitHub.com, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim as an unobtrusive extension. GitHub Copilot provides suggestions for numerous languages and a wide variety of frameworks, but works especially well for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Go, C# and C++.

### Add the Visual Studio Code extension

Here is how you can add the Visual Studio Code extension.

- In the Visual Studio Code Marketplace, go to the GitHub Copilot extension page and click **Install**
- A popup will appear, asking to open Visual Studio Code, and then click **Open Visual Studio Code**
- In the Extension: GitHub Copilot tab in Visual Studio Code, click **Install**
- If you have not previously authorized Visual Studio Code in your GitHub account, you will be prompted to sign in to GitHub in Visual Studio Code
  - If you have previously authorized Visual Studio Code in your GitHub account, GitHub Copilot will be automatically authorized.
- In your browser, GitHub will request the necessary permissions for GitHub Copilot. To approve these permissions, click Authorize **Visual Studio Code**
