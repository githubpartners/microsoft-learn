It's no secret that AI is disrupting the technology landscape. AI is going to profoundly change the way the world works and how each organization and team operate. These advancements will serve as a catalyst and dramatically improve the productivity of developers around the world if we use and apply it well.

When it comes to developers, adding AI features to the developer tools you use and love will help you collaborate, develop, test, and ship your products faster and more efficiently than ever before.

GitHub Copilot is a service that provides you with an AI pair programmer that works with all of the popular programming languages and dramatically accelerates overall developer productivity. In recent research, GitHub and Microsoft have found that developers experience a significant productivity boost when working on real world projects and tasks when using GitHub Copilot. In fact, in less than two years since its launch, developers have experienced the following while using GitHub Copilot.

- 46% of new code is now written by AI
- 55% faster overall developer productivity
- 74% of developers feel more focused on satisfying work

Developed in collaboration with OpenAI, GitHub Copilot is powered by OpenAI Codex, an AI system created by OpenAI. OpenAI Codex has broad knowledge of how people use code and is significantly more capable than GPT-3 in code generation, in part, because it was trained on a data set that includes a much larger concentration of public source code.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension for Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Neovim, and the JetBrains suite of integrated development environments (IDEs).

## GitHub Copilot X

GitHub Copilot started a new age of software development as an AI pair programmer that keeps developers in the flow by auto-completing comments and code, but AI-powered auto-completion is just the starting point. GitHub Copilot X is the vision for the future of AI-powered software development adopting OpenAI's newest GPT-4 models. Below are some of the upcoming features with GitHub Copilot X.

GitHub Copilot X extends past the editor and into a readily accessible AI assistant throughout the entire development life cycle.

Here are some features you can expect from GitHub Copilot X.

### A ChatGPT-like experience in your editor with GitHub Copilot Chat

Copilot X will bring a chat interface to the editor that’s focused on developer scenarios and natively integrates with VS Code and Visual Studio. It recognizes what code a developer has typed, what error messages are shown, and it’s deeply embedded into the IDE. A developer can get in-depth analysis and explanations of what code blocks are intended to do, generate unit tests, and even get proposed fixes to bugs.

### Copilot for Pull Requests

This new functionality is powered by OpenAI’s new GPT-4 model and adds support for AI-powered tags in pull request descriptions through a GitHub app that organization admins and individual repository owners can install. These tags are automatically filled out by GitHub Copilot based on the changed code. Developers can then review or modify the suggested description.

### AI-generated answers about documentation

GitHub is launching GitHub Copilot for Docs, an experimental tool that uses a chat interface to provide users with AI-generated responses to questions about documentation—including questions developers have about the languages, frameworks, and technologies they’re using.

### Copilot for the command line interface (CLI)

Next to the editor and pull request, the terminal is the place where developers spend the most time. But even the most proficient developers need to scroll through many pages to remember the precise syntax of many commands. GitHub Copilot CLI can compose commands and loops, and throw around obscure find flags to satisfy your query.

## GitHub Copilot for Business

GitHub Copilot is available through GitHub personal accounts with GitHub Copilot for Individuals or through organization or enterprise accounts with GitHub Copilot for Business.

With Copilot for Business, you can manage access to GitHub Copilot for organizations within your enterprise. Once you grant an organization access to GitHub Copilot, the administrators of that organization can grant access to individuals and teams.

With GitHub Copilot for Business, GitHub Copilot is open to every developer, team, organization, and enterprise.

Focused on making organizations more productive, secure, and fulfilled, GitHub Copilot for Business allows developers to code faster and allows them to focus on more satisfying work.

Here are some features you can expect from Copilot for Business:

- A more powerful AI model: New modeling algorithms improve the quality of code suggestions.
- AI-based security vulnerability filtering: GitHub Copilot automatically blocks common insecure code suggestions by targeting issues such as hardcoded credentials, SQL injections, and path injections.
- VPN proxy support: GitHub Copilot works with VPNs, including with self-signed certificates, so developers can use it in any working environment.
- Simple sign-up: Any company can quickly purchase Copilot for Business licenses online, and easily assign seats—even if they don’t use the GitHub platform for their source code.
