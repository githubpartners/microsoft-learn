In this unit we'll be going over the following:

- Signing up for GitHub Copilot
- How to Configure GitHub Copilot with Visual Studio Code

Now let's dive into how to get started with Signing up for GitHub Copilot.

## Signing up for GitHub Copilot

You need to set up a free trial or subscription for your personal account before you can start using GitHub Copilot. 

You can do so by clicking on your profile photo and then found in **Settings**. 

After you sign up, you will need to install an extension for your preferred environment. GitHub Copilot supports GitHub.com, Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim as an unobtrusive extension. 

But for this specific module we will just be reviewing extensions and configurations for Visual Studio Code since the exercise we complete in this module will use Visual Studio Code.

If you are using a different environment, we will provide links to GitHub Docs under the Relevant links section at the end of this module that will review installing extensions and configuration. 


## Configuring GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code

### Adding the Visual Studio Code extension

Here is how you can add the Visual Studio Code extension.

- In the Visual Studio Code Marketplace, go to the GitHub Copilot extension page and click **Install**
- A popup will appear, asking to open Visual Studio Code, and then click **Open Visual Studio Code**
- In the Extension: GitHub Copilot tab in Visual Studio Code, click **Install**
- If you have not previously authorized Visual Studio Code in your GitHub account, you will be prompted to sign in to GitHub in Visual Studio Code

GitHub Copilot can autocomplete code as you type when you use Visual Studio Code. After installation, you can enable or disable GitHub Copilot, and you can configure advanced settings within Visual Studio Code.
