Code scanning workflows that use CodeQL have various configuration options that can be adjusted to better suit the needs of your organization.

When you use CodeQL to scan code, the CodeQL analysis engine generates a database from the code and runs queries on it. CodeQL analysis uses a default set of queries, but you can specify more queries to run, in addition to the default queries.

You can run extra queries if they are part of a CodeQL pack (beta) published to the GitHub Container registry or a QL pack stored in a repository.

There are two options for specifying which queries you want to run with CodeQL code scanning:

- Using your code scanning workflow
- Using a custom configuration file

In this unit, you will learn about:

- Specifying additional queries in a workflow file
- Using CodeQL query packs
- Combining queries from a workflow file and a custom configuration file

## Specify additional queries in a workflow file

The options available to specify the additional queries you want to run are:

* `packs` to install one or more CodeQL query packs (beta) and run the default query suite or queries for those packs.
* `queries` to specify a single `.ql` file, a directory containing multiple `.ql` files, a `.qls` query suite definition file, or any combination.

You can use both packs and queries in the same workflow.

We don't recommend referencing query suites directly from the `github/codeql` repository, like `github/codeql/cpp/ql/src@main`. Such queries may not be compiled with the same version of CodeQL as used for your other queries, which could lead to errors during analysis.

## Use CodeQL query packs

> [!Note]
> The CodeQL package management functionality, including CodeQL packs, is currently in beta and subject to change.

To add one or more CodeQL query packs (beta), add a `with: packs:` entry within the `uses: github/codeql-action/init@v1` section of the workflow. Within packs you specify one or more packages to use and, optionally, which version to download. Where you don't specify a version, the latest version is downloaded. If you want to use packages that are not publicly available, you need to set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to a secret that has access to the packages.

In the example below, scope is the organization or personal account that published the package. When the workflow runs, the three CodeQL query packs are downloaded from GitHub and the default queries or query suite for each pack run. The latest version of `pack1` is downloaded as no version is specified. Version 1.2.3 of `pack2` is downloaded, as well as the latest version of `pack3` that is compatible with version 1.2.3.

```yml
- uses: github/codeql-action/init@v1
  with:
    # Comma-separated list of packs to download
    packs: scope/pack1,scope/pack2@1.2.3,scope/pack3@~1.2.3
```

> [!Note]
> For workflows that generate CodeQL databases for multiple languages, you must instead specify the CodeQL query packs in a configuration file.

### Use queries in QL packs

To add one or more queries, add a `with: queries:` entry within the `uses: github/codeql-action/init@v1` section of the workflow. If the queries are in a private repository, use the `external-repository-token` parameter to specify a token that has access to check out the private repository.

```yml
- uses: github/codeql-action/init@v1
  with:
    queries: COMMA-SEPARATED LIST OF PATHS
    # Optional. Provide a token to access queries stored in private repositories.
    external-repository-token: ${{ secrets.ACCESS_TOKEN }}
```

You can also specify query suites in the value of queries. Query suites are collections of queries, usually grouped by purpose or language.

The following query suites are built into CodeQL code scanning and are available for use.

|Query suite|Description|
|---|---|
| `code-scanning` | Queries run by default in CodeQL code scanning on GitHub. |
|  `security-extended` | Queries of lower severity and precision than the default queries |
| `security-and-quality` | Queries from security-extended, plus maintainability and reliability queries |

When you specify a query suite, the CodeQL analysis engine will run the queries contained within the suite for you, in addition to the default set of queries.

## Combine queries from a workflow file and a custom configuration file

If you also use a configuration file for custom settings, any additional packs or queries specified in your workflow are used instead of those specified in the configuration file. If you want to run the combined set of additional packs or queries, prefix the value of packs or queries in the workflow with the `+` symbol.

In the following example, the `+` symbol ensures that the specified additional packs and queries are used together with any specified in the referenced configuration file.

```yml
- uses: github/codeql-action/init@v1
  with:
    config-file: ./.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml
    queries: +security-and-quality,octo-org/python-qlpack/show_ifs.ql@main
    packs: +scope/pack1,scope/pack2@v1.2.3`
```
