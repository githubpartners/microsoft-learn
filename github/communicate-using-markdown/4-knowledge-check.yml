  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following Markdown snippets would produce this text: *Hello, **world**!*?"
    choices:
    - content: "`*Hello, *world*!*`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This would produce *Hello, *world*!*."
    - content: "`**Hello, *world*!**`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This would produce **Hello, *world*!**."
    - content: "`*Hello, **world**!*`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Remember that you can also use underscores (`_`) instead of asterisks if you prefer."
  - content: "How do you print certain characters, like asterisks (`*`) and underscores (`_`), literally on your output?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use three in a row, like `***` or `___`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This won't get you the results you're looking for."
    - content: "Escape them with a backslash, like `\\*` or `\\_`."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You can also escape other reserved characters, including `{` and `#`, using backslashes."
    - content: "Unfortunately, this is not supported at this time."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This question was written in Markdown and uses those characters, so it's definitely possible."
  - content: "Suppose there is an HTML snippet that you want to include on your GitHub Pages web site, but Markdown doesn't offer a way to render it. What should you do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Just add the HTML inline."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Markdown is not a complete replacement for HTML, so it's understood that you may need to add HTML in to get the final results you're looking for."
    - content: "Cut the content. If it's not supported in Markdown, then it's probably not worth including."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You can include HTML snippets in Markdown."
    - content: "Open an issue that requests Markdown support for your very specialized scenario."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This path would offer a very low chance for success. Why not just put the HTML inline?"
