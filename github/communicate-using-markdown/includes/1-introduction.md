Markdown is a markup language that offers a lean approach to content editing. It defines a concise, lightweight syntax that strips out the overhead inherent to HTML, providing a more approachable creation experience. It's become the standard for sites like GitHub, and enjoys broad editor support in both client and browser forms.

Suppose you're filing a bug report on GitHub. In order to provide depth and context, you'd like to emphasize parts of your text, provide a list of reproduction steps, enumerate your observations, and possibly embed screenshots with links to logs. Further, you'd like to reference other issues or lines of code and mention specific team members to be sure they have visibility on the issue. Markdown enables all of these scenarios on GitHub, and does so in a clear, convenient way.

In this module, you'll learn how to use Markdown in order to communicate more expressively throughout GitHub.
