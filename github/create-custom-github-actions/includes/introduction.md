GitHub Actions allow you to create individual, custom actions by writing code that interacts with your repository in any way you'd like, including integrating with GitHub's APIs and any publicly available third-party API. For example, an action can publish npm modules, send SMS alerts when urgent issues are created, or deploy production-ready code.

You can write your own custom actions to use in your workflow or share the actions you build with the GitHub community. To share actions you've built with the community, your repository must be public. Actions can run directly on compute resources, such as virtual machines, or in Docker containers. You can also define an action's inputs, outputs, and environment variables.

In this module, you learn the different ways to create a custom action, its necessary metadata and syntax, and how to publish a custom action to the GitHub Marketplace.
