GitHub Actions allow you to create individual, custom actions by writing code that interacts with your repository in any way you'd like, including integrating with GitHub's APIs and any publicly available third-party API.

Suppose you are a developer needing your actions to run in a specific environment configuration, need custom solutions for npm modules, or deploying production-ready code. By utilizing GitHub Actions, you can write your own custom actions to use in your workflow or share the actions you build with the GitHub community. GitHub Actions can run directly on computer resources, such as virtual machines, in Docker containers, or by utilizing Node.js. You can go beyond just DevOps when you use GitHub Actions to run workflows when other events happen in your repository. And for example, you can run a workflow to automatically add the appropriate labels whenever someone creates a new issue in your repository.

In this module, you'll learn the different ways to create a custom action, its necessary metadata and syntax, and how to publish a custom action to the GitHub Marketplace.

### Learning objectives

In this module, you will learn how to:

- Identify the metadata and syntax needed to create custom GitHub actions
- Learn best practices to publish a private or public GitHub action
- Publish a newly created action to the GitHub Marketplace
- Create custom JavaScript based actions

### Prerequisites

This module assumes you have basic familiarity with GitHub Actions and workflows.

- A GitHub account
- The ability to navigate and edit files in GitHub
  - For more information about GitHub, see [Introduction to GitHub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-to-github/).
- Basic familiarity with GitHub Actions and workflows
  - If you aren't familiar with workflows, jobs and steps, check out the [Automate development tasks by using GitHub Actions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/github-actions-automate-tasks/) module.
- Basic familiarity with continuous integration using GitHub Actions and workflows
  - If you're unfamiliar with continuous integration using GitHub Actions and workflows, check out [Build continuous integration workflows by using GitHub Actions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/github-actions-ci/)

Up next, learn about the metadata, syntax, and workflow commands to create custom GitHub Actions.
