GitHub Actions allow you to create individual, custom actions by writing code that interacts with your repository in any way you'd like, including integrating with GitHub's APIs and any publicly available third-party API.

Suppose you are a developer needing custom solutions for npm modules, sending SMS alerts when urgent issues are created, or deploying production-ready code. By utilizing GitHub Action, you can write your own custom actions to use in your workflow or share the actions you build with the GitHub community. GitHub Actions can run directly on computer resources, such as virtual machines, or in Docker containers. You can go beyond just DevOps when you use GitHub Actions to run workflows when other events happen in your repository. And for example, you can run a workflow to automatically add the appropriate labels whenever someone creates a new issue in your repository.

In this module, you'll learn the different ways to create a custom action, its necessary metadata and syntax, and how to publish a custom action to the GitHub Marketplace.

Next up, learn about the metadata, syntax, and workflow commands to create custom GitHub Actions.
