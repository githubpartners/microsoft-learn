  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What is **not** a good reason to create a pull request?"
    choices:
    - content: "You would like to receive feedback on prospective changes before merging your feature branch into `main`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Pull requests are a great way to collaborate on proposed changes."
    - content: "You want to merge your bug fix branch into `main`, but do not have permission."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Many projects protect important branches and require changes to be reviewed via pull request before approving."
    - content: "Your branch cannot be merged into `main` due to upstream changes made since you created it. Creating a pull request will let the other contributor know they need to pull their changes out so you can put yours in."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is not how pull requests work. Also, the etiquette is for you to be sure your branch can be cleanly merged into the base before creating a pull request."
  - content: "How can you ensure that pull requests for a given area of the repository are not merged unless certain users or teams have approved?"
    choices:
    - content: "Clearly explain the pull request policy in `CONTRIBUTING.md`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While this file is a great way to explain your contribution policy, it does not automatically enforce anything."
    - content: "Use a `CODEOWNERS` file and enable required reviews."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A `CODEOWNERS` file enables you to assign users or teams as required reviewers using the same syntax as `.gitingore` files."
    - content: "Add a table mapping directory paths to required users in `SECURITY.md`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While this file is a great way to explain your security policy, it does not automatically enforce anything."
  - content: "You have been requested to review a pull request. As you read through it, you notice several minor coding errors and typos. How should you handle the review?"
    choices:
    - content: "Start a review and fix obvious typos inline. Add comments in places that require further discussion or offer educational value. Complete the review with changes requested."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Contributors always appreciate when reviewers show an interest in getting their code merged."
    - content: "Leave single comments for each issue you come across, but do not change the code. For typos, include the correct spelling of the word as a reference. Approve the pull request if you trust the author to implement your suggestions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You should only approve a pull request when it's ready to merge."
    - content: "Reject the pull request. We can't risk any bugs accidentally being merged into an important branch."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "If the problems in a pull request are minor, it is often worth working with the contributor to fix them so the other changes may be merged."
