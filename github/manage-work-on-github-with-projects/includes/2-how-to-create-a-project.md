## Creating an organization level project

First we want to lay the foundation of your Project by creating a new Project. This is fairly simple and you can do this relatively quickly.

1. First, in the top right corner of GitHub.com, click your profile photo, then click **Your organizations**.

2. Once on Your organization page, click the name of your organization you want to create a new Project for.
3. Under your organization name, click **Projects**.
4. Then click the green button labeled **New Project**. 
5. Next it will ask you to select either a template or an empty project. Let’s start from scratch and select **Table** and then click the green **Create** button. 

You just created a Project! 

You can also create a personal Project by clicking your profile photo and navigating to **Your projects**. Once you are on your Projects page, you can simply click on the green button titled **New project**. 

## Setting your project’s name, description, and README

Let’s define your project in a couple of different ways so that your team can easily understand what you're tracking. 

1. To edit your project’s name, description and README navigate to your newly created project and in the top right, click the 3 dots to open the menu.
1. In the menu, click **Settings**.
1. And here you can edit the name of the project and it will save automatically.
1. Next add a short 5-7 word description of the project and make sure to click save afterwards. 
1. Then to update your project’s README, under **README**, type out a bit more information for your team to understand why you created this project and what you hope to accomplish with it. And when you’re done make sure to click save.

## Adding issues and pull requests to your Project

Adding in issues and pull requests to your Project is what makes it so powerful. It allows you to know the status of tasks your team is working on in order to coordinate and complete your goals. 

Let’s go through the different ways to add issues and pull requests to your project. 

### Adding an existing issue and pull request
1. First, copy the url of an existing issue or pull request. 
2. Next, place your cursor in the bottom row of the project, next to the **+** and paste the URL of your issue or pull request.

3. Finally press return and your issue or pull request will appear as a task in your project.

### Searching for an existing issue and pull request
1. You can also search for existing issues or pull request by simply adding a new item. 
2. Enter #.

3. Select the repository where the pull request or issue is located. You can type part of the repository name to narrow down your options.
4. Select the issue or pull request. You can also start typing the title to find the one you want. 

### Bulk adding issues and pull request

If you have an existing repository that you’d like to track using Projects bulk adding issues and pull requests saves you time and allows you to start organizing your team faster. 

1. First in the bottom row of the project, click **+**. 
2. Next, click **Add item from repository**. 
3. To change the repository, click the dropdown and select a repository. The issues and pull requests will populate.
4. You can either select all or select the ones you want to include.

In the next unit you will learn how to organize and prioritize your project in order to keep your tasks on track.
