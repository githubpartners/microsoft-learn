## How to configure built-in automation

With built-in automation, your Project will take newly created issues or pull requests and automatically put them into your Poject with a Todo status, helping you stay aware of all of your work.

To enable automation first go to the top-right corner of your Project and click on the three dots to open the menu. 
1. Next, in the menu, click **Workflows**.

2. In the left column, under Default workflows, select **Item added to project**.

Options include Item added to project, Item reopened, Item closed, Code changes requested, Code review approved, Pull request merged with Item added to project highlighted":::
3. Now in the center of the page, where it says **When**, ensure that both issues and pull requests are selected.
4. Below click on **Set** and click **Status:Todo**.
5. Finally in the right corner of the page, ensure the toggle is turned **On**. 

Congratulations! Youâ€™ve just automated your project!
