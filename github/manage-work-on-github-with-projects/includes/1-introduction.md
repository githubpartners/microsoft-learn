We know that your work is dynamic. Priorities can change quickly and needing to stay current and aware of everything is how you and your team can be successful. 

Luckily GitHub Projects can help you stay organized, connected, and up-to-date in order to keep your team on track. 

Projects connects your planning directly to the work your team is doing and flexibly adapts to whatever your team needs at any point. Built like a spreadsheet, project tables give you a live canvas to filter, sort, and group issues and pull requests. You can use it, or the accompanying project board, along with custom fields, to track a sprint, plan a feature, or manage a large-scale release.
