<!-- 1. Topic sentence(s) ---------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: briefly state that this unit will define the product.

    Heading: none

    Example: "Let's start with a few definitions and a quick tour of the core features of Logic Apps. This overview should help you see whether Logic Apps might be a good fit for your work."
-->
TODO: add your topic sentences(s)

<!-- 2. Background-concept definitions (optional) ----------------------------------------

    Goal:
        Define any needed underlying concepts or terms the learner must know to understand the product.
        Repeat this pattern multiple times if multiple concepts are needed.

    Heading:
        "## What is (concept)?"

    Pattern:
        1. H2 heading.
        2. Lead sentence that gives a definition "(concept) is..." (ensure this is a definition, do not give use cases like "(concept) lets you...").
        3. Additional text as needed (typically 1-3 paragraphs total, integrate the lead sentence into the first paragraph).
        4. Visual like an image, table, list, code sample, or blockquote (image preferred).

    Example:
        (Note: the product "Logic Apps" implements business processes in the cloud; therefore, "business process" is a background concept.)
        Heading: "What is a business process?
        Lead sentence: "A business process or _workflow_ is a sequence of tasks that produce a specific outcome. The result might be a decision, some data, or a notification...."
-->
## What is (concept)?

TODO: Add your additional text
TODO: Add your visual element

<!-- 3. Define the product -------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal:
        Give a formal and precise definition of the product.

    Heading:
        "## (product) definition"

    Pattern:
        1. H2 heading.
        2. Lead sentence that gives a definition "(product) is..." (ensure this is a definition, do not give use cases like "(product) lets you...").
        3. Additional text as needed (typically 1-3 paragraphs total, integrate the lead sentence into the first paragraph).
        4. Visual like an image, table, list, code sample, or blockquote (image preferred).

    Example:
        Heading: "Azure Logic Apps definition"
        Lead sentence: "Azure Logic Apps is a cloud service that automates the execution of your business processes."
-->
## (product) definition

TODO: Add your additional text
TODO: Add your visual element

<!-- 4. Solve the scenario -------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal:
        At a high level, describe how the (product) solves one of the customer tasks in your (scenario).
        Avoid teaching how to actually do the work (you're not teaching how-to-use in this module).

    Heading:
        "## How to (solve scenario)"

    Pattern:
        1. H2 heading.
        2. Lead sentence that summarizes how the (product) solved the (scenario).
        3. Additional text as needed (typically 1-2 paragraphs total, integrate the lead sentence into the first paragraph).
        4. Visual like an image, table, list, code sample, or blockquote (image preferred).

    Example:
        Heading: "How to implement a Twitter monitor"
        Lead sentence: "To implement a Twitter monitor, you map each task to a Logic Apps component and connect them with conditional logic."
-->
## How to (solve scenario)
TODO: Add your lead sentence
TODO: Add your additional text
TODO: Add your visual element

<!-- 5. Additional content (optional, as needed) ------------------------------------------------

    Goal:
        The section is a catch-all for any information not covered in the sections above.
        Repeat the pattern here as many times as needed.

    Possible topics:
        - Key feature(s).
        - Example use case in addition to the scenario.
        - High-level of how practitioners use the product (e.g. there's an API and a web UI to support multiple use cases).
        - Business value (e.g. it lets you do something that would be difficult to achieve without (product)).

    Pattern:
        Break the content into 'chunks' where each chunk has three things:
            1. An H2 or H3 heading describing the goal of the chunk.
            2. 1-3 paragraphs of text, with a strong lead sentence in the first paragraph.
            3. Visual like an image, table, list, code sample, or blockquote (image preferred).
