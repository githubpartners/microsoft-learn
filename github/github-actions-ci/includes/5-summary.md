In this module, you implemented a CI solution using GitHub Actions and workflows. 

You can now:

- Create a workflow from a template
- Understand the GitHub Actions logs
- Save and access build artifacts
- Automate reviews in GitHub using workflows
- Use partial re-runs
- Simplify using secrets with reusable workflows
- Discover code scanning partner integrations
- How to use default environment variables and contexts
- Access the workflow logs from the user interface

## Next steps

To continue your journey with GitHub Actions, check out the next module on this learning path, where you'll expand on what you have learned here and use GitHub Actions in continuous delivery and implementing infrastructure as code.
