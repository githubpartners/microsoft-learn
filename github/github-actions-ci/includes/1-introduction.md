GitHub Actions can be used to implement *continuous integration* (CI) for code that is maintained in GitHub repositories. CI is the practice of using automation to build and test software every time a developer commits changes to version control. CI helps teams discover issues early in the development process in order to find solutions quickly.

Imagine your team is developing a website to improve the experience customers have when they contact product support. A number of features are under development and you want to make sure the team can build and test them easily so that each one can be quickly added to the website. Because the code for the project is stored in a GitHub repository, you decide to use GitHub Actions for your CI project.

In this module, you learn how to implement continuous integration using GitHub Actions and workflows in your GitHub repositories.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Build and test a Node.js project by using GitHub Actions and a templated workflow
- Debug a failed test using the GitHub Actions Log
-  And customize your workflow with GitHub Actions

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- The ability to navigate and edit files in GitHub
  - For more information about GitHub, see [Introduction to GitHub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-to-github)
- Basic familiarity with GitHub Actions and workflows
  - If you are unfamiliar with GitHub Actions or workflows, check out [Automate development tasks by using GitHub Actions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/github-actions-automate-tasks/)

Next, we'll cover GitHub Actions and workflows for CI.
