GitHub Actions allows you to customize your workflows to meet your unique needs. You can configure a GitHub Actions workflow to be triggered when an event occurs in your repository, such as an issue being created or a pull request being opened.

Imagine that you and your team want to automate some tasks commonly found in a developer workflow. This could be the processes to build and test your pull requests, deploy your application every time a release is created, or add labels to issues every time one is opened. Github Actions workflows allow you to do all of these things and more!
