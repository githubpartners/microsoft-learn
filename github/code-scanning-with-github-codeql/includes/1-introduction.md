Code scanning using CodeQL provides an extensible method to automate vulnerability scanning across your organizations GitHub repositories.

Imagine that you are a senior developer at a start-up company specializing in health care software. Your flagship product is a Java-based web portal that allows physicians to manage patient records. A recent penetration test of this product revealed a number of serious vulnerabilities that could compromise patient information. The CIO has asked you to implement automated code vulnerability scanning. Because your code is already hosted in a private repository on GitHub, you have decided to use the code scanning feature with CodeQL. You will need to understand how the feature works to persuade other developers and management to use the feature. You will also need to understand the various configuration options and how to implement and maintain a code scanning pipeline to assist other developers at your company in configuring and deploying code scanning correctly.

In this module, you will learn about the CodeQL static analysis tool and how the code scanning feature in GitHub uses it to automate vulnerability scanning. You will also learn how to customize a code scanning workflow that uses CodeQL, how to include additional queries, and how to adapt your workflow to repositories that have multiple languages.

Next up, you'll learn how CodeQL is used by developers.
