GitHub projects support virtually unlimited scale. The upside of this scale is that your projects can grow to include countless files, commits, issues, pull requests, and more. The downside is, well, the same.

Suppose you're a developer working on a rapidly growing project. As more contributors come on board, they're able to add features and fix bugs at an incredible rate. However, every one of those changes likely includes a lot of contextual information buried in issues, discussions, commits, and pull requests. While that information seems fresh in everyone's mind at the time, the risk of losing that context as time passes could cost you some significant productivity down the road. What happens when a bug is reported that traces back to work that hasn't been touched for more than a year? Fortunately, GitHub offers a few ways to help you quickly ramp up for any task.

In this module, you'll learn how to search and organize repository history by using filters, blame, and cross-linking on GitHub.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Find relevant issues and pull requests.
- Search history to find context.
- Make connections within GitHub to help others find things.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- The ability to navigate and edit files in GitHub

This module covers the process of finding and organizing information on GitHub. To fully appreciate the benefits this module discusses, we recommend that you complete the following modules first:

- [Introduction to GitHub](/training/modules/introduction-to-github)
